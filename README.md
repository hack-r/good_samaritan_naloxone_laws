# good_samaritan_naloxone_laws
This code replicates of the estimates from  the Journal of Law & Economics article "With a Little Help from My Friends: The Effects of Good Samaritan and Naloxone Access Laws on Opioid-Related Deaths" (Rees, Sabia, Argys, Dave and Latshaw).

The original Stata code and data were replicated in R. Results show that the published OLS results in Table 5 (column 1) and Table 6 (column 2) do not correspond to the published code or model specification described in the paper. I reached out to the lead author weeks ago but have yet to receive a response. 

Code for recovering Stata's clustered standard errors may be found at the end of the R file.
